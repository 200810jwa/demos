# Week 5 Study Guide
Topics Covered: DevOps and Hibernate (also Sonar, Unix, and AWS)

Review the material covered from the week, which is listed out below.

Leverage the "How to do well in QC" Document that is pinned to the Training channel on Slack.

In particular, be able to answer "Tell me about your experience with X?", where X is any of the topics listed below.

Be able to provide overall reasons `Why` certain features are available. Such as what problems they solve.

## Topics
- [AWS](notes/aws.md)
  - Amazon Web Services
  - Cloud Platform for a variety of different services
  - Cloud Models
    - Software as a Service
    - Platform as a Service
    - Infrastructure as a Service
    - There technically more categories, but these are 3 primary ones
  - Software Infrastructure Components
  - Common AWS Services
    - RDS = Relational Database Service
    - EC2 = Elastic Compute Cloud

    - IAM = Identity & Access Management
    - Route 53
    - Security Groups
  - Pay as you go Model
  - The concept of autoscaling is very important
    - Vertical Scaling
    - Horizontal Scaling
    - The history behind them
- Unix/Linux
  - Filesystem is different from windows
  - There is a parent/root folder called "/"
    - Home folders are /home/username
  - Linux Commands
    - man
    - sudo
    - cd
    - ls

    - chgrp
    - groupadd
    - cat
    - rm
    - mkdir
- [Sonar](notes/sonar.md)
  - Family of software that focuses on analyzing code quality
  - SonarLint
    - A Linter
  - SonarCloud
    - A cloud dashboard for analyzing code quality of projects
    - [SonarCloud.io](http://www.sonarcloud.io)
  - SonarQube
    - A private Server that runs the same software as SonarCloud
    - It's just private to your own company/projects
- DevOps
  - 3 DevOps Practices
    - Continuous Integration
    - Continious Delivery
    - Continuous Deployment
    - Remember the above names(There is NO "Continuous Development")
  - Concept of a [Pipeline](notes/pipeline.md)
    - Automating the steps for deployment
  - There are a variety of "CI tools" to create pipelines for different purposes
    - Not every pipeline needs to automate every step
    - And there are some small pipelines to do very specific actions
    - Jenkins
    - GitHub Actions
    - AWS CodeBuild/CodeRun
    - Travis CI
    - Circle CI
    - and more
  - Remember the steps to set up a Jenkins Pipeline
    - As well as SonarCloud analysis with GitHub Actions
    - There is a recording if you need to review
- [Hibernate](notes/hibernate.md)
  - ORM = Object Relational Mapper
  - Allows us to perform SQL Operations in an Object Oriented Way
  - Hibernate API
    - Configuration Class
      - Represents configuration for the `hibernate.cfg.xml` file
    - SessionFactory Interface
    - Session Interface
      - get
      - load
      - persist
      - save
      - merge
      - update
      - delete
    - Transaction Interface
      - commit
      - rollback
  - Ways to perform Queries
    - Criteria Query API
    - HQL = Hibernate Query Language
      - JPQL = Java Persistence Query Language
      - Similar to HQL, but technically different
        - Associated with the JPA standard
    - NativeSQL Queries
  - Caches
    - L1 cache
      - Provided
      - Session-Scoped cache
    - L2 cache
      - Not Provided
      - SessionFactory-Scoped cache
  - Object States
    - TRANSIENT
    - PERSISTENT
    - DETACHED
  - We can configurate the mappings in 2 ways
    - XML Configuration
      - `hibernate.cfg.xml`
      - `Name.hbm.xml`
    - JPA Annotations
      - JPA = Java Persistence API
      - Standard for ORMs that Hibernate follows/supports
      - Be familiar with the annotations
  - NamedQueries
    - Can be configured in XML or with annotations
  - Be familiar with how to implement a variety of DAOs with Hibernate
