# Week 1 Study Guide
Topics Covered: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, Servlets

Review the material covered from the week, which is listed out below.

Leverage the "How to do well in QC" Document that is pinned to the Training channel on Slack.

In particular, be able to answer "Tell me about your experience with X?", where X is any of the topics listed below.

Be able to provide overall reasons `Why` certain features are available. Such as what problems they solve.

Additionally, all of the notes in the [Monday topics](notes/monday-topics.md) are also included.

  - Ways to Include JavaScript
    - Script tag
      - src attribute
  - Closures
    - A means to encapsulate scopes
      - Particulary you encapsulate an outer scope by returning an inner function
  - Functions are first class objects
  - Prototypal Inheritance vs Classical Inheritance
    - javaScript now has both with ES5
    - `__proto__` property
    - Also now there is a `Prototype` property that is newer
  - DOM Manipulation
    - Select elements with document object
      - getElementById
      - getElementsByClassName
      - getElementsByTagName
      - getElementsByName
      - etc
      - These functions can be invoked sequentially to become more specific
    - innerHTML property
    - other attributes
  - AJAX = Asynchronous JavaScript And XML
    - An API for sending HTTP Requests
    - HTTP Requests are an asynchronous process
    - Uses XMLHttpRequest objects
      - readyStates
        - 0: UNOPENED
        - 1: SENT
        - 2: HEADERS_RECEIVED
        - 3: LOADING
        - 4: DONE
      - onreadystatechange
        - callback that is invoked when the readyState changes
    - Fetch API
      - Uses Promises
      - A little bit nicer syntax than AJAX
    - Async/Await keywords
      - Introduced in ES7
      - Allow you to await a promise
      - Very clean syntactically
  - Template Literals
    - Strings declared with the grave key
    - Support String interpolation
  - Arrow Functions
    - JavaScript's anonymous functions
  - Event Listeners
    - We can attach Event Listeners either through pure HTML with an attribute similar to "onclick"
    - We can also create Event Listeners directly in JavaScript
      - addEventListener() method
        - takes a callback function, and a boolean to determine the phase
        - false => bubbling (default)
        - true => capturing
- [Servlets](notes/servlets/servlets.md)
  - An API to handle HTTP Requests
  - Servlet Heirarchy
    - Servlet Interface
      - GenericServlet Abstract Class
        - HttpServlet Abstract Class
          - CustomServlet classes
  - Servlet LifeCycle
    - init() method called once
      - `load-on-startup` tag to load before 1st Request
    - service() method called many times
    - destroy() method called once
  - ServletConfig vs ServletContext
    - ServletContext is shared with all Servlets
      - `context-param` tag
    - ServletConfig is specific to 1 Servlet
      - `init-param` tag
  - forward vs sendRedirect
    - forward is server-side
      - Client will not notice the forward happen at all
      - There is 1 Request/Response
      - `req.getRequestDispatcher().forward()`
    - sendRedirect is client-side
      - Client will see the webpage redirect
      - There are 2 Request/Responses
        - The first Response has a 3XX status code
      - `resp.sendRedirect()`
  - Configuring Servlets
    - Use `@WebServlet` annotation or configure in `web.xml`
      - Using the `servlet` and `servlet-mapping` tags
        - `servlet-name`, `servlet-class`, `url-pattern` tags
  - Processing forms
    - Form Data is accessible via `req.getParameter()`
    - If the Form was submitted as GET
      - Data will be visible in URL
    - If the Form was submitted as POST
      - Data will not be visible in URL
  - Process Body of the Request
    - `req.getReader()`
  - Writing to body of the Response
    - `resp.getWriter()`
    - Uses PrintWriter type
  - Can provide custom error pages
    - Using `error-page` tag in `web.xml`
  - Can create filters
    - Using `filter` and `filter-mapping` tags in `web.xml`
      - `filter-name`, `filter-class`, and `url-pattern` tags
- General Web Architecture
  - Tomcat is our Web Server
    - Also known as a Servlet Container or Web Container
    - Tomcat will create a new thread for every Request
  - HTTP [Request/Response Cycle](notes/servlets/request-response.md)
    - `web.xml` is called the Deployment Descriptor
  - [Design Patterns](notes/servlets/design-patterns.md)
    - Front Controller
      - Only 1 Servlet
    - MVC = Model - View - Controller
  - HTTP = HyperText Transfer Protocol
    - Request
      - URL
      - Request Parameters
      - Request Headers
      - Request Body
      - HTTP Version
      - HTTP Method
        - GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, OPTIONS, HEAD, TRACE, INFO, etc
    - Response
      - Response Headers
      - Response Body
      - HTTP Version
      - Status Code (Know some examples)
        - 1XX: Informational
        - 2XX: Success
          - 200 OK
          - 201 Accepted
          - 204 No Content
        - 3XX: Redirections
          - 300 Redirected
        - 4XX: Client-Side Errors
          - 400 Bad Request
          - 401 Unauthorized
          - 404 Not Found
          - 418 I am a Teapot
        - 5XX: Server-Side Errors
          - 500 Internal Server Error
- [REST](notes/servlets/rest.md) = REpresentational State Transfer
  - Considers data to be "resources"
  - We use the Jackson-Databind dependency in Java
    - Convert back and forth between Java objects and JSON
  - The API focuses on manipulating these resources
  - Constraints of REST
    - Cacheable
    - Stateless
    - Layered Architecture
    - Client-Server Relationship
    - Uniform Interface
    - (Optional) Code on Demand
  - REST often uses Path Variables
    - Embedding useful information about the request in the URL
      - Such as ID or username
