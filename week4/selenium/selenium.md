# Selenium WebDriver

Selenium is a software tool to automate controlling the browser. How you use it from there is 100% up to you. Generally speaking, Selenium sees a lot of use in regards to testing. Particularly, testing websites/webpages to ensure that they have the functionality that they are supposed to.

## Other tools
There are a few other Selenium tools along with Selenium WebDriver, but we will not be using them in training.

## Requirements

We will use a particular driver specific to the browser we intend to automate. For chrome, there is a chromedriver, for Firefox there is a geckodriver, etc.

We will also have a dependency in our maven project for `selenium-java`.

From there, we can use our WebDriver, as well as an associated API to manipulate the browser.
