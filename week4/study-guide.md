# Week 4 Study Guide
Topics Covered: Angular & Selenium

Review the material covered from the week, which is listed out below.

Leverage the "How to do well in QC" Document that is pinned to the Training channel on Slack.

In particular, be able to answer "Tell me about your experience with X?", where X is any of the topics listed below.

Be able to provide overall reasons `Why` certain features are available. Such as what problems they solve.

## Topics
- Node
  - Runtime Environment for JavaScript external to the browser
  - It allows you to run JavaScript "directly" without needing a browser
- NPM
  - Node Package Manager
  - General Package Manager, specific to Node Packages
  - We installed Angular with npm
- Angular
  - Uses TypeScript
    - A SuperSet of JavaScript
      - All JavaScript is also valid TypeScript
    - Has optional type safety/strong typing
      - syntax: `let myVar: type = value`
        - e.g.: `let username: string = "username"`
    - Types
      - all JS types
      - `any`
        - Type to use JS's dynamic typing functionality
      - `void`
        - Standard return type that means no return
      - `never`
        - Interesting return type that means the function will never complete
          - Only valid with functions that have something like an infinite while-loop
    - Has many type related features
      - Interfaces
      - Generics
    - Access Modifiers
      - public
      - private
      - protected
      - There is NO default access
        - The lack of a modifier -> public access
    - Has Decorators
      - Similar to Annotations in Java
  - Angular CLI
    - Command Line Interface
    - `ng new` to create a new Angular Project
    - `ng generate` to generate files based off of miscellaneous schematics
      - `ng generate component myComponent`
      - `ng generate service employeeService`
      - etc
    - `ng serve`
      - Creates a development server to host Angular project at `localhost:4200`
  - Primary Schematics/Structures of Angular
    - Modules
      - Used `@NgModule` decorator
      - Is a high level organizational structure
      - Contains services and components
      - Has some useful lazy-loading features
    - Services
      - Represent isolated, independent logic, that is not tied to a view
      - Uses the `@Injectible` decorator
      - Can be "injected" into a component through Angular's Dependency Injection (DI) system
        - Just have the service as a parameter in the constructor of a component
      - Often useful to contain a variety of needed HTTP Requests organized within services
        - Then the components can just use the methods on the service
      - They can also be used in a way to cache data and pass it around between components
    - Components
      - Represent a "portion" or "section" of a webpage
      - Has 3 files: `.ts`, `.html`, and `.css`
      - The `.html` and `.css` form the "view"
      - The .`ts` file controls the logic of the view
      - Components can be nested within other components
        - Creating a large-scale HAS-A structure of components
      - Uses the `@Component` decorator
  - Minor schematics
    - Pipes
      - Useful structures to transform data into other data
      - Very versatile, but most commonly used to transform strings
      - Can be used to filter input data
        - However, performance-wise, this can be very impactful
        - Be VERY careful about how much data you hand to a pipe that will filter data
        - Perhaps 20 or so maximum
    - Directives
      - Can create custom directives
      - But there are many built in directives
  - Built in Directives
    - Structural Directives
      - Prefixed with an asterisk *
      - *ngFor
      - *ngIf
      - ngSwitch (no asterisk, uses property binding)
        - *nSwitchCase
        - *ngDefaultCase
    - Attribute Directives
      - ngClass
      - ngStyle
    - Component Directive
      - Components are technically a directive
  - Databinding
    - A means to bind data back and forth between `.ts` and `.html`
    - String Interpolation
      - Uses `{{ }}` syntax
        - `<p>{{ username }}</p>`
      - Used to bind information from `.ts` -> `.html` innerHTML content
    - Property/Attribute Binding
      - Uses `[]` syntax
        - `[href]="url"`
      - Used to bind information from `.ts` -> `.html` element attributes
    - Event Binding
      - Uses `()` syntax
        - `(click)="onclick()"`
      - Used to trigger functions in `.ts` in response to events from `.html`
    - Two-Way Databinding
      - Doesn't really have a name, but could refer to it as ngModel
      - Uses `[(ngModel)]` syntax
      - Require the `FormsModule` to be imported
      - Specifically works with `input` tags
      - Binds data from `.html` input tag to `.ts` variable and back to `.html` elements
  - Routing System
    - Because Angular creates "Single Page Applications" or SPAs
    - The router helps simulate multiple webpages, when in fact, there is only 1
    - It allows us to bind components to be displayed in response to a `router-outlet` tag
    - You can customize the paths that Router leverages
      - And these routes can be configured across multiple Modules
  - Angular's Version History
    - AngularJS, which was built using JavaScript
    - Angular, which was built using TypeScript
      - Often referred to as Angular 2.0 or just Angular 2
      - But it's not perfect, because AngularJS also had a version 2
    - We have to be very careful about how we refer to Angular
  - RxJs Observables
    - Similar to Promises, however, they can receive multiple values
      - Promises can only receive one
    - Observables can be cancelled, Promises cannot
    - There are small differences
    - Overall, they are quite similar
      - Can even convert Observables into Promises with `.toPromise()`
    - Observables allow for multiple "listeners" on the same "data stream"
      - Can be quite powerful when leveraged
  - HttpClientModule & HttpClient Service
    - Built to send HTTP Requests using Obervables
    - The HttpClient Service requires the `HttpClientModule` to be imported
    - Can be injected anywhere you need
      - Either directly in a component
      - Or in another service that you create
    - RxJs Subjects
      - An expansion on the idea of Observables
      - Allow for multiple inputs to the "data stream"
      - Creates an overall Publisher/Subscriber architecture
        - Which is a very useful Design Pattern in technology, even disregarding Angular
        - Often abbreviated as "PubSub"
- Selenium
  - It is a tool to automate/control the browser
  - There is Selenium WebDriver, Selenium Grid, and Selenium IDE
    - We will ONLY use Selenium WebDriver
    - IDE can be useful, but often uses xpath, which is very sensitive to change
      - So scripts created with IDE often break shortly thereafter
  - We use Selenium in the context of testing web applications
    - We create e2e tests (end to end tests)
    - They are designed to test a web application from end to end
      - Frontend to Backend
    - They are a form of integration or system test
      - The category depends on the scale of the test and application
    - Our goal is to verify that our web application functions and behaves "as expected"
  - We leverage a Page Object Model Design Pattern
    - We create classes to represent a single webpage
    - With fields of corresponding important elements on the page
    - With methods to interact with the elements
  - Selenium uses a browser-specific driver
    - ChromeDriver
    - GeckoDriver (FireFox)
    - SafariDriver
    - etc
  - The Selenium API in java comes from the `selenium-java` package from Maven
  - Implicit vs Explicit waits
    - Implicit waits will wait "up to" a certain amount of time before operations are available
      - Such as an element being clickable
      - Applies universally
    - Explicit waits will wait as long as you say, or until a very specific operation is available
      - Applies to specific scenarios
    - Technically also Fluid Waits
      - Explore on your own
  - API
    - WebDriver
      - chromedriver, etc
    - WebElement
      - Similar to HTMLElement in JavaScript
    - ExpectedConditions
      - In regards to explicit waits
- SDLC
  - Software Development LifeCycle
    - 6 phases
  - Review [here](./notes/SDLC.md)
  - Of particular note
    - Agile Practices (AKA DevOps Practices)
      - CI/CD or CI/CD/CD
      - Continuous Integration
      - Continuous Delivery
      - Continuous Deployment
    - Remember what they are, their names, and their order
      - People often misremember CD as "Continuous Development"
      - But this *does not exist*
  - Waterfall vs Agile
    - What are they?
    - How do they differ?
  - Agile Scrum details
    - Artifacts
    - Meetings
    - Roles
