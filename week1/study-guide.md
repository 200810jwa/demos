Review the material covered from the week, which is listed out below.

Leverage the "How to do well in QC" Document that is pinned to the Training channel on Slack.

In particular, be able to answer "Tell me about your experience with X?", where X is any of the topics listed below.

Be able to provide overall reasons `Why` certain features are available. Such as what problems they solve.

        - IOException
        - ClassNotFoundException
      - Error
        - StackOverflowError
        - OutOfMemoryError
  - Checked/Unchecked Exceptions
    - What differentiates them
  - When do Checked Exceptions Occur?
  - When do Compile-time Exceptions occur?
    - Answer: At Runtime
  - Create Custom Exceptions
- JUnit

  - Specifically different from manual testing
  - Annotations
    - @Test
    - @Before

  - Assert Methods
    - Static methods to assert certain expectations
    - assertTrue
    - assertEquals
    - assertArrayEquals
    - assertNotEquals
  - Test Driven Development (TDD)
    - Write tests FIRST
    - Then create application code to make them pass
    - You may even create class names and method names off the top of your head
      when writing tests, and then create application code to fix the syntax errors
- File I/O
  - FileInput/OutputStreams
    - Process 1 byte at a time
  - FileReader/Writers
    - Process 1 character (2 bytes) at a time
  - BufferedReader/Writers
    - Process entire Strings at a time
  - Scanner
    - Console input when using System.in
- Serialization

    - TreeMap
  - Understand the characteristics of each data structure
  - Leverage Generics
    - The `<Integer>` or `<T>` syntax

  - Best practices
    - small-scale: lowercase branch names
    - large-scale: Pull before you push
      - Commit & push frequently to avoid large merge conflicts
